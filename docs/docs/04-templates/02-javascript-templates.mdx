# JavaScript Templates

This templating system IS NOT [the same that Home Assistant implements](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating). It is basically a `JavaScript` code block in which you can use certain client-side objects, variables and methods. To set a property as a `JavaScript` template block, include the code between three square brackets `[[[ JavaScript code ]]]`. If you donâ€˜t use the square brackets, the property will be interpreted as a regular string.

The `JavaScript` code will be taken as something that you want to return, but if you have a more complex logic, you can create your own variables and return the desired result at the end.

The entities used in the templates will be stored, so if the state of an stored entity changes, all the templates that use this entity will be reevaluated and rerendered. On top of this, if the variable `panel_url` is used in a template, the template will be reevaluated every time that a new panel or a new view is loaded.

`JavaScript` templates can make use of [Reactive JavaScript Variables](../advanced-configuration-options/javascript-variables#reactive-javascript-variables). If you use a reactive variable in some templates and you modify it in the `javascript` action of an `on_click` parameter of an item, all the templates in which the variable was used will be reevaluated in the device in which the action was performed.

### Example

The next example will set the next options:

1. Sets the title of the sidebar as "My Home" followed by the current time.
2. Sets the background of the sidebar `red` when the panel config is selected and `green` otherwise.
3. Adds the number of `HACS` updates as a notification in the `HACS` item in the sidebar. In case that there are no updates, an empty string is returned and in these cases the notification will not be displayed.
4. Creates a new item that redirects to the `Home Assistant` info page with a dynamic text with the word "Info" followed by the installed Supervisor version  between parentheses and the Operating System version in the info text.
