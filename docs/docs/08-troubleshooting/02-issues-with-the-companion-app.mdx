# Issues with the Companion App

:::info

Check first if the customisations are not applied also in a browser, if that is the case, go to [Customisations are not applied](./customisations-are-not-applied).

Home Assistant has a strong caching system. If you notice that the customisations are applied correctly in all your browsers but not in the Companion App, first thing to do is to clean the WebView cache (it is not the same as the App cache). Follow these steps:

## Companion App iOS version

1. Go to the sidebar and click on `App configuration`
2. Go to `Debugging` and click on `Reset frontend cache`
3. Close the App and open it again and check if the customisations are applied

## Companion App Android version

1. Go to the sidebar and click on `Settings`
2. Scroll down until you see `Companion app` item and click on it
3. Scroll down until you see `Troubleshooting` item and click on it
4. Click on `Reset frontend cache`
5. Close the App and open it again and check if the customisations are applied
