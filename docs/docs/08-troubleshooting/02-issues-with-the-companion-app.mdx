# Issues with the Companion App

:::info

Check first if the customisations are not applied also in a browser, if that is the case, go to [Customisations are not applied](./customisations-are-not-applied).

Home Assistant has a strong caching system. If you notice that the customisations are applied correctly in all your browsers but not in the Companion App, first thing to do is to clean the WebView cache (it is not the same as the App cache). Follow these steps:

## Companion App iOS version

1. Go to the sidebar and click on `App configuration`
2. Go to `Debugging` and click on `Reset frontend cache`
3. Close the App and open it again and check if the customisations are applied

## Companion App Android version

Unfortunately, there is no a native button to clean the WebView cache in Android. Until [this](https://github.com/home-assistant/android/issues/2460) is not resolved, alternative methods will be needed.

The easiest way to clean the WebView cache is to log-out from the App and log-in again, but this is a hassle because you will need to reconfigure everuthing again. The safest way is to follow these steps:

1. Go to `Settings`
2. Go to `Companion App > Debug > WebView Remote Debug` and activate it
3. Set up [Chrome Remote Debugging]
4. Open `chrome://inspect/#devices` in Chrome browser
5. Inspect the WebView relative to Home Assistant
6. Go to `Application` and click on `Storage`
7. Uncheck `Local and session storage` and `Cookies`
8. Click on `Clear site data`
9. Close the App and open it again and check if the customisations are applied
