# Warning about not matching sidebar items

This warning means that you have an item in your configuration that doesn't match any sidebar item.

## Matching by text

By default the matching of the sidebar items is done by text. If you are not using the `exact` property with value `true` the text can be a substring of the text in the sidebar item. You need to avoid having a text that could match more than one item, if you have two items with a very similar text or with the same text, you should match by `href` (consult the `match` property in [Main Configuration Options > Order Items Properties](../configuration/main-configuration-options#order-items-properties)).

## Using a language different from English

If you are using a language different from English, it is possible that when Custom Sidebar tries to match your sidebar item this has not been translated yet. If you are having issues related to Custom Sidebar matching some of your items half of the time, most probably this is provoked by the aforementioned issue. Match by `href` in these cases because these attributes are independent from the chosen language. (consult the `match` property in [Main Configuration Options > Order Items Properties](../configuration/main-configuration-options#order-items-properties)).
