## Root Configuration Options

| Options            | Type                               | Required | Description |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| order              | [items](#order-items-properties)[] | no | List of sidebar items to process and customise. Consult the [Order Item Properties](#order-items-properties) for the documentation of the options inside each order item |
| hide_all           | Boolean                            | no       | Hides all items of the sidebar by default, useful if one wants to hide everything and just show a few items. (This options doesn't make any effect in an item with the property `new_item` in `true`) |
| title<sup>\*</sup> | String                             | no       | Custom title to replace the `Home Assistant` title |
| subtitle<sup>\*</sup> | String                          | no       | Sets a custom subtitle below the `Home Assistant` title |
| sidebar_editable<sup>\*</sup> | Boolean or String       | no       | If it is set to `false`, long press on the sidebar title will be ignored and the button to edit the sidebar in the profile panel will be disabled. As a string it should be a JavaScript or a Jinja template that returns a boolean or a promise that resolves in a boolean |
| sidebar_mode       | String                             | no       | Defines the default status of the sidebar when Home Assistant is loaded. It has three possible values: "hidden" to make the sidebar hidden, "narrow" to make the sidebar visible in narrow state and "extended" to make sidebar visible in extended state. This option will show or hide the sidebar ignoring if it is a desktop or a mobile device or if the `Always hide the sidebar` switch in the profile page in on or off (depending on the value of this option, this switch will be switched on or off automatically) |
| width              | Number, String or Object                   | no       | Defines the width of the sidebar. If it is a number or a string, it will set the same width in `extended` and `hidden` mode. If it is an object, it can set the width of each sidebar mode separetely providing the `extended` and `hidden` properties. |
| default_path<sup>\*</sup> | String             | no       | Defines the default URL path when the page loads. This path must start with `/` |
| analytics                          | Boolean or Object  | no       | If this value is `true`, sidebar usage will be logged in [Logbook](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logbook/). This option also allows an object, and in this way it is possible to decide which kinds of events will be logged. Consult the [Sidebar Analytics](./sidebar-analytics#decide-which-events-will-be-logged) section for more information about this |
| exceptions                          | [exceptions](./exceptions)[]  | no       | List of exceptions to provide different configurations per user or device. Consult the [exceptions](./exceptions) section. |

:::tip

\* These options allow [JavaScript](../templates/javascript-templates) or [Jinja](../templates/jinja-templates) templates.

:::

:::warning[Important]

* Items located in the `order` option will appear first. This means that any items present in the Sidebar, but not in the `order` option, will be shown **on the bottom** of the list that they belong (top or bottom).
* The `default_path` option will change the default behaviour and every time that the page loads it will navigate to this path (either when the page loads for the first time or when it gets refreshed). If you don't want to have this behaviour and you would prefer to load Home Assistant in an specific path or refresh a specific page without being redirected to the `default_path`, then you should not set this option.
* If you use a `Jinja template` in the `default_path` option, a Websocket connection needs to be established to render the template, so there will be a delay before redirecting to the returning path. For this reason, it is recommended that you use a `Javascript` template instead because it is executed straightaway.
* If you use a template in the `default_path` option, it will be compiled only on page load. If any of the entities used in the template changes, it will do nothing until the page is refreshed or one tries to enter directly in a path from the URL.
* When the `width` property (or one of its properties) is a number, the width will be set in pixels. When it (or one of its properties) is a string, it should have the proper format, this is an integer followed by one of these units: `%`, `em`, `ex`, `px`, `rem`, `vh`, `vmax`, `vmin`, `vw`. `extended` mode is when the sidebar is always visible (typically in desktop devices) and `hidden` mode is when the sidebar is hidden and it needs to be shown clicking on the header's top-right button (typically in mobile devices).

## Order Items Properties

| Property                  | Type    | Required  | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| item                      | String  | yes       | This is a string that will be used to match each sidebar item by its text or its `href`. If the `exact` property is not set, it is case insensitive and it can be a substring such as `developer` instead of `Developer Tools` or `KITCHEN` instead of `kitchen-lights` |
| match<sup>\*\*</sup>      | String  | no        | This property defines what should be used to match the string in the `item` property. It has two possible values "text" (default) to use the text content of the sidebar item, or "href" to use the `href` attribute of the sidebar item |
| exact                     | Boolean | no        | Specifies whether the `item` string match should be an exact match (`true`) or not (`false`) |
| order                     | Number  | no        | Sets the order of the sidebar item |
| hide<sup>\*</sup>         | Boolean or String | no | Setting this property to `true` will hide the sidebar item and if the property `hide_all` from the main configuration is `true`, setting this property as `false` will avoid hiding the item |
| name<sup>\*</sup>         | String  | no        | Changes the name of the sidebar item |
| icon<sup>\*</sup>         | String  | no        | Specifies the icon of the sidebar item |
| info<sup>\*</sup>         | String  | no        | Sets the content of the info text (a smaller secondary text below the main item text) |
| notification<sup>\*</sup> | String  | no        | Add a notification badge to the sidebar item |
| bottom                    | Boolean | no        | Setting this property to `true` will move the item to the bottom fixed items (Configuration, Notifications, etc). If you don't set this property or set it as `false`, the items will be placed in the top main sidebar items |
| href                      | String  | no        | Specifies the `href` of the sidebar item. You don't need to specify this property if the item is an existing one (unless you want to change its `href`) |
| target                    | String  | no        | Specifies the [target property] of the sidebar item |
| on_click                  | [action](./the-on-click-property)  | no     | It allows to execute actions when the sidebar item is clicked. Consult [the on_click property](./the-on-click-property) section for more details |
| attributes<sup>\*</sup>   | String or Object | no | Object (or a template string which returns an object) that defines a group of attributes that will be applied to the sidebar item. The properties of this object must be strings, numbers or booleans |
| divider                   | Boolean | no        | Adds a divider line below the item |
| new_item                  | Boolean | no        | Set this property to `true` to create a new item in the sidebar. If you use this property you need to provide an `icon` property and either a `href` or an `on_click` property |

:::tip

\* These options allow [JavaScript](../templates/javascript-templates) or [Jinja](../templates/jinja-templates) templates.

\*\* If you match by `href` and you are not sure what is the specific `href` of an item, add `cs_debug` parameter to the URL and reload your `Home Assistant` instance (e.g. `http:your-home-assistant-domain:8123?cs_debug`). You will see different debug messages in the browser's console. Open the one that says `custom-sidebar debug: Native sidebar items` and you can see a table with each sidebar item, its text and its respective `href`.

:::

:::warning[Important]

* All items should have a unique `item` property.
* Avoid an `item` property that could match multiple elements. If you find that an `item` property matches multiple elements, try to use the `match` and `exact` properties to match the specific item that you want to match.
* The items will be ordered according to their `order` property OR in the order of appearance.
* If you use the `order` property in at least one item, make sure either all items (except hidden ones) have this property, or none of them (otherwise order may be messed up).
* `Profile` item doesn't have a `href` because it is a button and it doesn't redirect to any dashboard. This means that it should be matched only by its text, it cannot be matched by `href`.
* Take into account that if you don't set the `bottom` property in an item from the bottom list, it will take it as `false` and therefore it will move this item to the top.
* If you set the order or hide items from the sidebar, it is recommended that you don't use Home Assistant functionality to reorder/hide items, because it will conflict with the functionality of the plugin.
