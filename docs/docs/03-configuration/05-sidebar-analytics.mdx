# Sidebar Analytics

It is possible to log sidebar usage through [Logbook](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logbook/) entries. In this way you can analyse which users make a higher usage of the sidebar, which items are the most clicked ones, if someone entered in a dashboard even if the item in the sidebar was hidden, etc.

To enable sidebar analytics, it is enough to define the `analytics` option as true.

<SimpleExample />

This will log any event registered by `Custom Sidebar` on Logbook. If the user logged in has a [person entity](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/person/) then this entity will be used to log the events.

## Decide which events will be logged

It is also possible to decide which kinds of events will be logged. For that you need to specify this option as an object and set the desired properties in `true`.

### Only log sidebar-items clicks

For this, you need to enable the parameter `sidebar_item_clicked`. It will log an entry every time that a sidebar item is clicked.

### Only log panels visits

For this, you need to enable the parameter `panel_visited`. It will log an entry when a panel is loaded, either after clicking on an entry that opens a panel or if the panel is visited by other means (through browser history, setting the panel in the URL, etc).
