# Configuration File

Depending on the file that you have added to [extra_module_url], you will need to add your configuration in `YAML` or `JSON` format. If you used `custom-sidebar-yaml.js` you need to provide the configuration in `YAML` format. If you have used `custom-sidebar-json.js` you need to provide the configuration in `JSON` format.

:::tip

In principle, using a `YAML` or a `JSON` configuration  is a matter of taste and preference. If you don't plan to use templates, there is no advantage of one over the other, but if you plan to use templates, specially complex ones, `YAML` is recommended because you can write code blocks in multiple lines. As `JSON` doesn't allow line breaks, you would need to write the complete template in a single line.

:::

Add a file named `sidebar-config.yaml` or `sidebar-config.json` into your `<config directory>/www/` directory. It is recommendable that you copy the [example sidebar-config.yaml] or the [example sidebar-config.json] file, delete the `id` parameter, and modify it to match your needs. It is recommended to start with the simplest configuration and start to extend it step by step, in that way if you suffer any issue, it is easy to identify with which code block it started.

If you want to check an extensive sidebar configuration which uses custom styles, variables and templates, check [@Mariusthvdb]'s [sidebar-config.yaml].
