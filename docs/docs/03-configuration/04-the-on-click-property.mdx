# The on_click property

The `on_click` property allows one to attach click actions to specific sidebar items. These actions will be triggered every time that the sidebar item containing an `on_click` property is clicked. The `on_click` property doesn't stop redirecting to a dashboard or to an external page if it is provided together with an `href` property. But if the `href` property is `#` (or it is just omitted in new items), then the `on_click` action will be executed without redirecting to any dashboard or external page.

### Navigate action

The `navigate` action allows one to navigate to a specific dashboard when an item is clicked. Using this action with a regular string doesn't have any advantage on top of just using the `href` item property, but the real power of this action is that it can generate the `path` to the dashboard using a [JavaScript template](../templates/javascript-templates), so there could be some logic involved to decide to which path should redirect the item when clicked.

:::warning

You should not use this action in an an item that contains an `href` property because the default functionality of redirecting to a dashboard taking into acount the `href` and the `navigate` action functionality will clash.

:::

:::info

When you visit a URL directly, there is a logic to select the proper sidebar item taking into account its `href`. You need to be aware that when using a `navigate` action, there is no way for the plugin to know that an item redirects to a dashboard path, so in those cases the item will not be selected.

:::

:::tip

1. The `path` parameter of a `navigate` action accepts a [JavaScript template](../templates/javascript-templates). The `JavaScript` template used there will have access to two variables: `item` and `itemText`. These variables are related to the clicked item, the first is the configuration object of the item (including an `element` property which is the HTML element relative to the sidebar item) and the second is the text of the item.
2. Apart from the `path` parameter, this action also accepts an optional `replace` boolean parameter to decide if the path should replace the current one in the history.

### Call service action

The `call-service` action allows one to call a specific service when a sidebar item is clicked. It rquires a `service` parameter indicating which is the service that one wants to execute and an optional `data` parameter in the cases that it is required by the service.

:::tip

The `data` parameter of a `call-service` action accepts [JavaScript templates](../templates/javascript-templates) in its values. The `JavaScript` templates used there will have access to two variables: `item` and `itemText`. These variables are related to the clicked item, the first is the configuration object of the item (including an `element` property which is the HTML element relative to the sidebar item) and the second is the text of the item.

<CallServiceAction />

### JavaScript action

The `javascript` action allows one to execute an arbitrary `JavaScript` code when the sidebar item is clicked. It requires a `code` parameter with the `JavaScript` template code without being enclosed between `[[[ ]]]`.

:::tip

All the properties and methods available in [JavaScript templates](../templates/javascript-templates) will be available in this `JavaScript` code. On top of this, it will also have access to two variables: `item` and `itemText`. These variables are related to the clicked item, the first is the configuration object of the item (including an `element` property which is the HTML element relative to the sidebar item) and the second is the text of the item.

### Open dialog action

The `open-dialog` action allows one to open a dialog when a sidebar item is clicked. It requires a `type` parameter indicating which kind of dialog should be open. The `type` parameter allows two values, `more-info` to open a more info dialog of an entity or `restart` to open the dialog to restart `Home Assistant`. If one specifies the `type` parameter as `more-info`, the action will require an `entity_id` parameter indicating which entity should shown the more info dialog.

:::warning[Important]

Take into account when using the `open-dialog` action with a `restart` `type`, that even if every user can open the restart dialog, only admin users are authorized to restart `Home Assistant`.
