# The on_click property

The `on_click` property allows one to attach click actions to specific sidebar items. These actions will be triggered every time that the sidebar item containing an `on_click` property is clicked. The `on_click` property doesn't stop redirecting to a dashboard or to an external page if it is provided together with an `href` property. But if the `href` property is `#` (or it is just omitted in new items), then the `on_click` action will be executed without redirecting to any dashboard or external page.

### Call service action

The `call-service` action allows one to call a specific service when a sidebar item is clicked. It rquires a `service` parameter indicating which is the service that one wants to execute and an optional `data` parameter in the cases that it is required by the service.

:::tip

The `data` parameter of a `call-service` action accepts [JavaScript templates](../templates/javascript-templates) in its values. The `JavaScript` templates used there will have access to two variables: `item` and `itemText`. These variables are related to the clicked item, the first is the configuration object of the item (including an `element` property which is the HTML element relative to the sidebar item) and the second is the text of the item.

### JavaScript action

The `javascript` action allows one to execute an arbitrary `JavaScript` code when the isdebar item is clicked. It requires a `code` parameter with the `JavaScript` code without being enclosed between `[[[ ]]]`.

:::tip

The `JavaScript` code will have access to two variables: `item` and `itemText`. These variables are related to the clicked item, the first is the configuration object of the item (including an `element` property which is the HTML element relative to the sidebar item) and the second is the text of the item.

### Open dialog action

The `open-dialog` action allows one to open a dialog when a sidebar item is clicked. It requires a `type` parameter indicating which kind of dialog should be open. The `type` parameter allows two values, `more-info` to open a more info dialog of an entity or `restart` to open the dialog to restart `Home Assistant`. If one specifies the `type` parameter as `more-info`, the action will require an `entity_id` parameter indicating which entity should shown the more info dialog.

:::warning[Important]

Take into account when using the `open-dialog` action with a `restart` `type`, that even if every user can open the restart dialog, only admin users are authorized to restart `Home Assistant`.
