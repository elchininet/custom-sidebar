# Exceptions

You can define user/device-specific options using the exceptions feature. Creating an exception basically means starting a new configuration different from the main one when certian matchers match. If multiple exceptions match with the current user/device, then they are merged from top to bottom creating a new configuration and if they have an `order` property, it will be merged too. As well as in the main configuration, it is possible to extend from [extendable configurations](../advanced-configuration-options/extendable-configurations) using the `extend_from` [advanced configuration option](../configuration/main-configuration-options#advanced-configuration-options). Consult the [Extendable Configurations section](../advanced-configuration-options/extendable-configurations) to know how two or more configurations are merged together.

:::info

Only in `exceptions`, it is possible to extend from the main configuration if the the `extend_from` option is used with the value `base`. Consult the [Extendable Configurations section](../advanced-configuration-options/extendable-configurations) to know how is the process of extending configurations.

:::

In an exception you can define all the configuration options from [the main configuration](../configuration/main-configuration-options) and [the themable configuration](../configuration/themeable-configuration-options) (excluding the [Advanced Configuration Options](main-configuration-options#advanced-configuration-options) `js_variables`, `jinja_variables`, `partials`, and `extendable_configs`). And on top of these options, the next ones will be available:

## Matcher Options

This options define how an exception should match with the current user or device.

| Options             | Type              | Required | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| user       | String or String[] | no          | Name of the user(s) you would like to display this order for. This option can be set alone or combined with `device`, `not_device`, `is_admin`, or `is_owner` |
| not_user   | String or String[] | no          | Name of the user(s) you would not like to display this order for. This option can be set alone or combined with `device`, `not_device`, `is_admin`, or `is_owner` |
| device     | String or String[] | no          | Device(s) you would like to display this order for. E.g. ipad, iphone, macintosh, windows, android (it uses the device's [user-agent]). This option can be set alone or combined with `user`, `not_user`, `is_admin`, or `is_owner` |
| not_device | String or String[] | no          | Device(s) you wouldn't like to display this order for. E.g. ipad, iphone, macintosh, windows, android (it uses the device's [user-agent]). This option can be set alone or combined with `user`, `not_user` `is_admin`, or `is_owner` |
| is_admin   | Boolean            | no          | Checks if the user is admin or not. This option can be set alone or combined with `user`, `not_user`, `device`, `not_device`, or `is_owner` |
| is_owner   | Boolean            | no          | Checks if the user is owner of the system. This option can be set alone or combined with `user`, `not_user`, `device`, `not_device`, or `is_admin` |

## Other Options

| Options             | Type              | Required | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| matchers_conditions   | `OR` or `AND`  | no  | Defines if at least one of the matchers should match (`OR` which is the default value) or if all the matchers should match (`AND`) |

:::warning[Important]

* Take into account that creating exceptions means creating a new configuration. By default, the options in the main configration will not be in the new configuration resulted from exceptions. If you would like to start with the same options from the main configuration and override some of them, you need to use the option `extend_from` with the value `base`. In this way the main configuration will be merged into the desired exception.
* Take into account that `user` and `not_user` make reference to the name of the user(s) not the usernames.
* If `matchers_conditions` is "OR" (default value), only one match from the matchers is needed for the exception to be picked. But if this option is "AND" then all of the matcher must match for the exception to be picked, in this case if any matcher does't match, then the exception will be discarded.
* You cannot use `user` and `not_user` at the same time, doing so will end in an error
* You cannot use `device` and `not_device` at the same time, doing so will end in an error
