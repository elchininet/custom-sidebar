# Overview

:::info

`Custom Sidebar`'s advanced configurations options are intended for advanced users. They are not strictly necessary and you can use the plugin without making use of them. The purpose of these options is to reduce code repetition and share configurations. It is advisable that you do not use them if they result confusing to you or if you don't understand their usage.
