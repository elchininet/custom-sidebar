# Extendable configurations

Extendable configurations (`extendable_configs`) is an object containing different configurations options that could be extended from the root configuration, from the [Exceptions](../configuration/exceptions) or from another extendable configuration, making them a very flexible option to share configuration blocks. To specify that a configuration should extend from an extendable configuration, the `extend_from` option should be used specifying the extendable configuration name(s).

Extending from a configuration basically means _"import what I don't already have"_, so if a configuration already has an option, it will prevail and it will not be overridden if the configuration is extended. For example, the next configuration has a main configuration extending from an extendable configuration named `example`, let's analyse what will be the result of that extend.

<ExatendableConfigurationsExample />

1. As the `title` option is defined in the main configuration, it will not get the `title` option from the extendable configuration.
2. As the `subtitle` option is not defined in the main configuration, it will be get from the extendable configuration.
3. As the main configuration and the extendable configuration both have an `order` option, it will be merged:
    1. Both orders have an `overview` item, so it will be merged. As the main config order-item has also an `order` property, it will not be extended, but as the extendable order-item has an `icon` property that doesn't exist in the main config order-item, it will be extended.
    2. As the extendable order-item doesn't have a `name` property, it will remain there.
    3. The `Integrations` doesn't exist in the extendable order so it will remain as it is.
    4. The `Google` extendable item doesn't exist in the main config, so it will be extended.

The resulted main config after the extending process will be:

<ExtendableConfigurationsResultExample />

It is possible to extend from multiple configurations and they will be extended in order, as shown in the next example:

<ExtendingFromMultipleConfigurationsExample />

As already mentioned, an extendable configuration can extend from other extendable configurations:

<ExtendingFromAnotherExtendableConfigurationExample />

The resulted main config will be:

<ExtendingFromAnotherExtendableConfigurationResultExample />

In the case of [Exceptions](../configuration/exceptions), they can also extend from the main configuration if `base` is used in the `extend_from` option:

<ExtendingFromBaseExample />

So, the configuration for the user `ElChiniNet` will be the same previous main config, plus an order with an order-item.

The next example is a more complex one extending from multiple configurations:

:::warning[Important]

* You need to be careful of circular dependencies when extending configurations, if this is detected an error will be thrown
* You can only use `base` inside `extend_from` if you are in an exception, trying to use it in the main config or in an extendable configuration will throw and error
