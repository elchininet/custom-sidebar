# Custom Sidebar Docs

This documentation contains all what you need to have `Custom Sidebar` up and running as well as optional theming and advanced configuration options.

Installing and configuring `Custom Sidebar` is a straighforward task, do not feel overwhelmed by the extensive documentation. The documentation is extensive because `Custom Sidebar` is highly flexible and provides a high amount of features and configuration options but not all the configuration options are strictly needed, most of them are optional or intended for advanced usages. In fact, almost all the configuration options are optional, it is up to you if you want to use them or not. 

If you feel that the documentation is not clear at any point, something is missing or can be improved, you can always open an [issue], a [discussion] or give feedback in the [Home Assistant forum].
