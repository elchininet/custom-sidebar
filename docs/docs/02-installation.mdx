# Installation

You can install the plugin manually or through [HACS], not both. **If you install the plugin using the two installations methods you could have issues or errors**.

### Through HACS

1. Go to `HACS` dashboard
2. Search for `custom-sidebar` and click on it
3. On the plugin page, click on the `Download` yellow button in the bottom-right corner
4. Click on `Download` in the more-info dialog
5. When the plugin is already downloaded, add the url of the plugin as an [extra_module_url] in your `configuration.yaml`:

<InstallThroughHacsExample />

6. Restart Home Assistant

:::warning[Important]

1. Do not get creative with the path of the plugin, use the provided one. If you have `HACS` installed [the hacsfiles custom path](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/repositories/type/dashboard/#custom-features-for-files-stored-under-hacsfiles) will be there even if you cannot see it in your filesystem.
2. Do not forget to restart Home Assistant.

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest [custom-sidebar release]
2. Copy `custom-sidebar-yaml.js` or `custom-sidebar-json.js` into `<config directory>/www/` (depending on the configuration format that you are going to use,  `YAML` or `JSON`)
3. Add the url of the plugin as an [extra_module_url] in your `configuration.yaml`:

4. Restart Home Assistant

:::tip

It is recommendable that you add the plugin's version at the end of the URL as a parameter (e.g. `?v=1.0.0`) to force Home Assistant to load the new version instead of a version stored in cache. This step is not mandatory, but if you start suffering from caching issues, this would be one of the first steps to perform.
