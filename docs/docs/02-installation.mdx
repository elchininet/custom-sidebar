# Installation

:::warning[Important]

If you have `Home Assistant` `2025.5.0` or greater installed, the minimum compatible version that you can install is `Custom Sidebar` `v10.0.0`. If you are in a lower version of `Home Assistant`, the latest compatible version that you can install is `v9.4.1`.

:::

You can install the plugin manually or through [HACS], not both. **If you install the plugin using the two installations methods you could have issues or errors**.

### Through HACS (recommended)

#### Go to the HACS plugin's page

If you have not disabled the [My Home Assistant] integration, just click on [this link](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=elchininet&repository=custom-sidebar&category=plugin) to go to the plugin's page, otherwise follow the next steps:

1. Go to `HACS` dashboard
2. Search for `custom-sidebar` and click on it

#### Install the plugin

1. On the plugin page, click on the `Download` yellow button in the bottom-right corner
2. Click on `Download` in the more-info dialog
3. When the plugin is already downloaded, add the url of the plugin as an [extra_module_url] in your `configuration.yaml`:

<InstallThroughHacsExample />

4. Restart Home Assistant

:::warning[Important]

1. Do not get creative with the path of the plugin, use the provided one. If you have `HACS` installed [the hacsfiles custom path](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/repositories/type/dashboard/#custom-features-for-files-stored-under-hacsfiles) will be there even if you cannot see it in your filesystem.
2. Do not forget to restart Home Assistant.

:::

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest [custom-sidebar release]
2. Copy `custom-sidebar-yaml.js` or `custom-sidebar-json.js` into `<config directory>/www/` (depending on the configuration format that you are going to use,  `YAML` or `JSON`)
3. Add the url of the plugin as an [extra_module_url] in your `configuration.yaml`:

<InstallationManualExample />

4. Restart Home Assistant

:::warning[Important]

1. The path `/local` makes reference to your public folder `<config directory>/www`. Use the `/local` path, do not use a path using your `config` or `www` directories because it will not work.
2. Do not forget to restart Home Assistant.

:::

:::tip

It is recommendable that you add the plugin's version at the end of the URL as a parameter (e.g. `?v=1.0.0`) to force Home Assistant to load the new version instead of a version stored in cache. This step is not mandatory, but if you start suffering from caching issues, this would be one of the first steps to perform.
