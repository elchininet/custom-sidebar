Sometimes it is useful to make a user land on a specific dashboard when Home Assistant is loaded. To achieve this, you can go to your profile and in the `Browser settings` there is a specific section to set the default dashboard in that device. But as the description states, this change will be only applied in that device and it is not permanent. This change will be lost if one logs out and logs in again or if one logs in in another device with the same user.

On top of this, this feature only allows to set certain dashboards, as the default one, the ones created manually or other specific dashboards as the Map Dashboard. If one wants to land in any other Home Assistant url when the system loads, that is not natively possible.

## default_path

With this option you can make Home Assistant loads a specific URL path every time that it loads, and using [exceptions](../configuration/exceptions), it is even possible to make these changes for specific users or devices, or create [custom matcher conditions](./exceptions-matchers-conditions). And these changes will be permanent as long as you keep them in the configuration.

For example, the next code example shows how to create a default URL path for every user and another one for admins.

:::warning[Important]

The `default_path` option will change the default behaviour and every time that the page loads it will navigate to this path (either when the page loads for the first time or when it gets refreshed). If you don't want to have this behaviour and you would prefer to load Home Assistant in an specific path or refresh a specific page without being redirected to the `default_path`, then you should not set this option.
