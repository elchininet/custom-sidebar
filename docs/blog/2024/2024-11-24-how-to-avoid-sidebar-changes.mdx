[Home Assistant] has [a native feature](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/pull/6755) to change the order of sidebar items or hide them. But this feature should not be used together with Custom Sidebar if you are using a custom order or hiding/showing items. So, in case that you are doing this you should disable this functionality.

Custom Sidebar has an option that will allow you to disable this `Home Assistant` feature.

## sidebar_editable

This option is `true` by default, which gives the normal behaviour in `Home Assistant`. If you set it to `false`, it will not only ignore clicking-and-hold on the sidebar's title, it will also disable the `EDIT` button in the `Change the order and hide items from the sidebar` in the user's profile.
